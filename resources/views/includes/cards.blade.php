            <h3>Kitchen Extension/Upgrade</h3>
            <p>Getting the electrics right is an important part of kitchen design and it's vital to get everything in
                the right place. While upgrading your kitchen design it makes sense to completely over-spec the
                electricity supply and provisions for appliances and gadgets as it's not a job you want to have to
                revisit a couple of years down the line.</p>

            <h3>Security Lighting</h3>
            <p>Security lighting is a brilliant way to deter any unwanted intruders and it is perfect for lighting up
                your home when you return and it's dark . Security lights use Passive Infrared (P.I.R) technology to
                detect human presence. These units have vastly improved over the years and are no longer prone to
                lighting up with small animal presence.</p>

            <p>Locating a fault in an electrical system quickly requires experience. We are trained and experienced at
                electrical fault finding and repairing domestic electric installations. This experience ensures a fast,
                efficient and cost-effective service. Once the fault has been identified, it can either be repaired
                immediately or booked to be carried out at a time convenient to you.</p>
